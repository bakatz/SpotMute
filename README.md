SpotifyAdMuter
================

"Mutes" spotify ads based on a user-created blacklist.

Instructions:

1. Open Spotify
2. Open SpotifyAdMuter.exe
3. Wait for an ad to show up on the screen.
4. Check the SpotifyAdMuter console window - it will ask you if you want to block the current ad from playing.
5. Press y for Yes or n for No.
6. Rinse and repeat steps 3 through 5 for each ad you want to block.

Note: For this initial version, the blacklist resides in memory. Future versions will support a blacklist 
configuration file and will whitelist everything else. Please message me with any feature suggestions!
