SpotMute v0.3
================
A simple blacklist and volume control application for Spotify. Uses a blacklist to determine what songs to automatically skip for you. 
If a song cannot be skipped, some happy elevator music will be played over the song, and the song's individual volume will be reduced to 2%.
