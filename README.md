SpotMute v0.2
================
A simple blacklist and volume control application for Spotify. Supports automatic artist/song skipping, automatic lowering of Spotify's volume, and playing MP3's over blocked songs if the song could not be skipped.

1. Click start.

Some of my own music will be played over the song in question.

Note: pressing stop will reset your volume to what it was before the mute operation.
